# Overview
Now you have a fully functional serverless application that allows users to sign in, save bookmarks for their own use, and submit bookmarks to be shared in the team knowledge base. Several tasks happen in parallel when a new bookmark is submitted for the knowledge base: The submitterâ€™s entry is entered into a contest, notifications are sent, and an automated publishing workflow is initiated. You have also incorporated logging and tracing, which will give you operational visibility into the production application. Finally, you incorporated security at all layers to protect your application.

As you have learned, a key part of developing serverless applications is to use your visibility into how the application is used in production to determine where to make future modifications. You should continue to monitor the production application to understand access patterns, resolve operational errors, and iteratively optimize your application to minimize costs and continually improve the user experience. Because your application uses small decoupled components, you can more easily modify components independently.

To support these types of small, frequent updates, you would like to automate the build and deployment processes so that the development team continues to focus on developing the application. In this lab, you learn how to set up a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline and do canary deployments on AWS.

The following diagram shows the architecture components that have been or will be deployed in this lab.

![architecture](/notes/images/SVILT-Labs-Lab6.png)

This lab uses the following services:
- AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)
- AWS Cloud9
- Amazon DynamoDB
- Amazon EventBridge
- Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)
- AWS Step Functions
- AWS CodeCommit
- AWS CodePipeline
- AWS CodeBuild
- AWS CodeDeploy
- AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)

## Remarks
- The setup of this application is depended on this module, refer to `setup.md` for detail instruction.
- The whole pipeline is setup using cdk script in `pipeline` folder.
- The role required is also setup through the `pipeline/lib/pipeline-stack.ts` file.
- There must be a CodeCommit repo as the source of truth for this pipeline with the name of repo strictly `app-code`.
